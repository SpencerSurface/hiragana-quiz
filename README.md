# Hiragana Quiz

## Description

This project is a web-based, multiple-choice quiz intended to help users memorize the Japanese hiragana characters. Users are shown a hiragana character and are asked to select the correct romanization for the character out of four choices. A score is given based on the number of questions correctly answered.

This project was written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. `index.html` contains the HTML for the webpage that displays the quiz. `style.css` contains the CSS that styles the page. `script.js` contains most of the JavaScript that makes the page function. `kana.js` contains a list of all the hiragana characters and their romanizations, which are then used in `script.js`.

In completing this project, I was able to further practice using web technologies, and I also started learning to read hiragana!
